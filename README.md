# Capstone_SpaceX
Capstone project for IBM for Data Science Professional Certificate
### Introduction 
In this project, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully or not. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of $62 million; other providers cost upward of $165 million each. The main reason for this saving is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Hence if we can determine whether the first stage will land or not, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

This capstone project course will give you a taste of what data scientists go through in real life when working with real datasets. You will assume the role of a Data Scientist working for a startup intending to compete with SpaceX, and in the process follow the Data Science methodology involving data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model development, model evaluation, and reporting your results to stakeholders. You are tasked with predicting if the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully.

### Business Problem Statement
We need to predict the likelihood of the first stage rocket landing successfully and subsequently determine the cost of a launch accurately. The findings can be  shared with the competing company(Space Y) to place more informed and calculated bids against Space X for rocket launch.

### Objective
1) To apply data science toolkit and machine learning in order to accurately predict the likelihood of the first stage rocket landing successfully, and thus determine the cost of a launch.
2) Explore the data in order to obtain more insight from the data.
3) Submit a complete business report of our findings to the stakeholders
